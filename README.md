# Look-disk-scheduling
Q34. Write a C program to solve the following problem: 
Suppose that a disk drive has 5,000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder 143, and the previous request was at cylinder 125. 
The queue of pending requests, in FIFO order is: 
86, 1470, 913, 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130 
Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders) that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the 
LOOK disk-scheduling algorithms?
